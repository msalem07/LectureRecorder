==================================
TextInput
==================================

Component that takes in User input.
These components also need have a height and width defined for them to be visible.
The prop method that responds to changes is actually called onChangeText, where the first argument is the text being inputed on the element.
Setting the value to the input field is actually the same as the React Input component
Since the TextInput needs a lot of styling and login you might want to make a common component that you can reuse;
Instead of types (like tel, email, password) there are specific props to let the component know how to handle the text (secureTextEntry for password)


===================================
Firebase
===================================

Library that handles login authentication among other things.
Can be initialized on the componentWillMount Lifecycle with the information found on the firebase console.
Must activate the types of authentication that you want your app to have on the console, and the npm library has the right calls for each one.
